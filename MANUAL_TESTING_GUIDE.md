# 🧪 Manual Testing Guide for Polygon POL Token Indexer

## 🎯 What This Assignment Expects

The assignment expects a **real-time blockchain indexer** that:

1. **Monitors Polygon network** for POL token transfers
2. **Identifies Binance-related transfers** (6 specific addresses)
3. **Calculates cumulative net-flows** (inflows - outflows)
4. **Provides query interfaces** (CLI and HTTP API)
5. **Stores data persistently** in SQLite database

---

## 🚀 Manual Testing Commands

### **Step 1: Start the Blockchain Indexer**

```bash
# Start the main indexer (this will run continuously)
./target/release/indexer
```

**What you should see:**

- Beautiful banner with your name
- "Starting blockchain monitoring..." message
- Connection to Polygon RPC
- Real-time block processing logs
- POL transfer detection messages

**Expected behavior:**

- Connects to Polygon network
- Processes new blocks every ~2 seconds
- Detects POL token transfers
- Stores Binance-related transfers in database

---

### **Step 2: Test CLI Interface (Open New Terminal)**

```bash
# Test CLI help
./target/release/cli --help

# Query current net-flow
./target/release/cli net-flow

# Check system status
./target/release/cli status

# View recent transactions
./target/release/cli transactions --limit 5

# View more transactions with pagination
./target/release/cli transactions --limit 10 --offset 5
```

**What you should see:**

- Beautiful CLI banner with your name
- Current cumulative net-flow (positive = more inflow, negative = more outflow)
- System status with last processed block
- Recent POL transfers involving Binance addresses
- Transaction details (block, hash, addresses, amounts)

---

### **Step 3: Test HTTP API (Optional)**

```bash
# Start the HTTP server (new terminal)
./target/release/server --port 8080

# Test API endpoints (new terminal)
curl http://localhost:8080/net-flow
curl http://localhost:8080/status
curl http://localhost:8080/transactions?limit=5
```

**What you should see:**

- JSON responses with net-flow data
- System status information
- Transaction data in structured format

---

## 📊 What to Look For During Testing

### **1. Real-time Blockchain Monitoring**

- ✅ System connects to Polygon network
- ✅ Processes new blocks continuously
- ✅ Logs show block numbers increasing
- ✅ POL token transfers are detected

### **2. Binance Address Detection**

- ✅ Only transfers involving these 6 addresses are stored:
  - `0xF977814e90dA44bFA03b6295A0616a897441aceC`
  - `0xe7804c37c13166fF0b37F5aE0BB07A3aEbb6e245`
  - `0x505e71695E9bc45943c58adEC1650577BcA68fD9`
  - `0x290275e3db66394C52272398959845170E4DCb88`
  - `0xD5C08681719445A5Fdce2Bda98b341A49050d821`
  - `0x082489A616aB4D46d1947eE3F912e080815b08DA`

### **3. Net-Flow Calculations**

- ✅ **Inflows**: POL tokens sent TO Binance addresses
- ✅ **Outflows**: POL tokens sent FROM Binance addresses
- ✅ **Net-Flow**: Inflows - Outflows (can be positive or negative)
- ✅ **Precision**: Shows decimal amounts correctly

### **4. Data Persistence**

- ✅ Database file `blockchain.db` is created
- ✅ Data survives system restarts
- ✅ Last processed block is remembered
- ✅ Net-flow accumulates over time

---

## 🔍 Key Test Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Fresh Start**

```bash
# Delete existing database
rm blockchain.db

# Start indexer
./target/release/indexer

# In another terminal, check initial state
./target/release/cli net-flow
# Should show: Net-flow: 0 POL (fresh start)
```

### **Scenario 2: System Recovery**

```bash
# Stop indexer (Ctrl+C)
# Restart indexer
./target/release/indexer

# Check it continues from last block
./target/release/cli status
# Should show: Last processed block continues from where it left off
```

### **Scenario 3: Data Accumulation**

```bash
# Let indexer run for 5-10 minutes
# Check net-flow periodically
./target/release/cli net-flow

# Should see net-flow changing as new transfers are detected
```

### **Scenario 4: Transaction History**

```bash
# View recent transactions
./target/release/cli transactions --limit 10

# Should show:
# - Block numbers
# - Transaction hashes
# - From/To addresses (one should be Binance)
# - POL amounts
# - Timestamps
```

## 📈 Expected Results

### **What Success Looks Like:**

1. **🔗 Network Connectivity**

   - Indexer connects to Polygon RPC
   - Processes blocks in real-time
   - No connection errors

2. **🎯 POL Token Detection**

   - Only POL token transfers are processed
   - Uses correct contract address
   - Parses ERC-20 Transfer events

3. **🏦 Binance Address Recognition**

   - Only stores transfers involving the 6 Binance addresses
   - Correctly classifies inflows vs outflows
   - Ignores irrelevant transfers

4. **🧮 Accurate Calculations**

   - Net-flow = Total Inflows - Total Outflows
   - Decimal precision maintained
   - Values accumulate correctly over time

5. **💾 Data Persistence**

   - SQLite database stores all data
   - System remembers state after restart
   - No data loss during operation

6. **🖥️ User Interfaces**
   - CLI commands work reliably
   - HTTP API returns valid JSON
   - Response times under 1 second

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **If Indexer Won't Start:**

```bash
# Check if port is available
netstat -an | findstr :8080

# Check RPC connectivity
curl https://polygon-rpc.com/

# Check database permissions
ls -la blockchain.db
```

### **If No Transfers Detected:**

- This is normal! POL transfers to/from Binance are relatively rare
- The system is working correctly even if no transfers are found
- You can verify it's working by checking the logs show block processing

### **If CLI Shows Errors:**

```bash
# Make sure indexer created the database first
./target/release/indexer
# Wait a few seconds, then try CLI commands
```
